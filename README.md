# Sudoku Solver

This is a solution to http://rubyquiz.com/quiz43.html, which gives a sudoku
puzzle to be solved using the Ruby programming language. This project deviates
slightly from the challenge by reading an input.txt file which contains the
puzzle rather than accepting the puzzle through the stdin.

## Getting Started

No installation necessary, just copy the files and directories.

### Prerequisites

This project runs in Ruby, and was written for version 2.3.3. It requires the
'set' gem (included in the Ruby standard library), and was written with version
2.6.8 of said gem.

### Installing

No installation necessary if Ruby is already installed, just copy the files and
directories.

To run, simply open a command line terminal in the 'lib' directory and run 'ruby
sudoku_solver.rb'. The solution will then be displayed one step at a time via
the stdout.

## Running the tests

No tests were made for this project.
